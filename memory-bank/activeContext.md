# Active Context

## Current Focus
The project is currently focused on finalizing a robust Neo4j sync implementation for Alkanes protostones with proper trace event handling. The core functionality is working and we've successfully synced over 1,400 blocks with 640+ protostones and 1,067 event nodes.

## Recent Changes

### Neo4j Repository Refactoring
- Added proper UTXO tracking with `:unspent` label
- Improved coinbase transaction handling for all blocks
- Enhanced error handling for missing outputs
- Streamlined transaction and output storage

### Project Structure Cleanup
- Removed unused files and legacy code
- Consolidated functionality into core components
- Created a clean CLI interface with Commander.js
- Added comprehensive Cypher queries for analysis

### Graph Model Enhancements
- Added event nodes for each trace event type
- Created proper relationships between all entities
- Implemented shadow output model for protostones
- Ensured clean data types for Neo4j compatibility

## Active Decisions

### Event Modeling Approach
We've decided to model each trace event type as a separate node with a `:trace` relationship to its protostone. This allows for:
- Easier querying of event patterns and co-occurrences
- Avoidance of Neo4j type errors with complex objects
- More efficient graph traversal for analytics
- Better visualization of event relationships

### UTXO and Coinbase Tracking
We're now properly tracking the UTXO set with the `:unspent` label and special handling for coinbase transactions. This ensures:
- Accurate representation of the Bitcoin protocol
- Support for UTXO analysis queries
- Proper tracking of spent vs unspent outputs
- Correct modeling of block rewards

### Error Handling Approach
For inputs referencing outputs we haven't seen (when syncing from a middle block):
- Create placeholder outputs to maintain graph consistency
- Allow for future syncs to replace placeholders with real data
- Log warnings for missing data but continue processing

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Verify graph model accuracy** with query analysis
2. **Optimize sync performance** for larger block ranges
3. **Consider adding indexes** for common query patterns
4. **Document query patterns** for common analytics

### Future Enhancements
1. **Real-time sync** capability for new blocks
2. **Enhanced analytics dashboard** using Neo4j Bloom
3. **API layer** for programmatic access to the graph
4. **Integration with other Alkanes tools** for comprehensive analysis
