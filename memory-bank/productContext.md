# Product Context

## Problem Statement
Bitcoin's blockchain contains embedded data structures called "protostones" that represent Alkanes protocol transactions. These protostones need to be extracted, analyzed, and stored in a way that preserves their relationships to the underlying blockchain data and allows for analysis of their trace event data.

## Why This Project Exists
1. **Data Integration**: Connects Bitcoin blockchain data with Alkanes protocol activity
2. **Analytics Foundation**: Provides a graph database for analyzing protostone and event patterns
3. **Protocol Development**: Supports development and debugging of Alkanes protocol functionality
4. **Historical Record**: Creates a traceable history of Alkanes protocol usage and evolution

## User Stories

### Data Scientists/Analysts
- Can query the Neo4j database to identify patterns in protostone usage
- Can analyze event type distributions and co-occurrences
- Can correlate blockchain activity with Alkanes protocol events

### Protocol Developers
- Can inspect historical protostone data including trace events
- Can verify correct protocol behavior in production
- Can identify anomalies or unexpected protocol behaviors

### System Operators
- Can sync blockchain and protostone data to a Neo4j instance
- Can verify sync status and monitor progress
- Can maintain a clean graph model for analytics

## User Experience Goals

1. **Clean Data Model**: The graph database should follow a consistent, logical structure that represents blockchain concepts accurately
2. **Efficient Sync**: Minimize processing time and resource usage during syncing
3. **Robust Error Handling**: Recover gracefully from API errors or temporary outages
4. **Analytic Flexibility**: Support a wide range of Cypher queries for extracting insights
5. **Low Maintenance**: System should require minimal operational oversight once configured

## Success Indicators

- **Data Completeness**: All blocks, transactions, outputs, addresses, protostones, and events are properly synced
- **Data Accuracy**: Relationships accurately reflect the blockchain and protocol state
- **Performance**: Sync and query operations complete in reasonable time
- **Usability**: Analysts can easily write Cypher queries to extract insights
